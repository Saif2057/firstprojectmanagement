## Reflection on Project Management Tools

Using project management features—such as milestones, issues, and project boards—can greatly enhance team collaboration and project organization. 
These tools provide a structured approach to tracking progress, assigning tasks, and ensuring everyone stays aligned with project goals.

**Milestones** help break down a project into key stages, setting clear targets and deadlines.
                     They allow the team to focus on smaller, manageable parts of a project while maintaining an overall vision.
                     This helps in keeping track of progress and assessing whether the project is on schedule. 
                     For example, achieving a milestone like "User Authentication Module" signals that a critical part of the Gym App is complete and ready for integration.

**Issues** act as a centralized space for tracking bugs, feature requests, and specific tasks.
They improve communication by allowing team members to comment, ask questions, and provide updates directly within each issue. 
This helps avoid miscommunication and ensures that everyone is aware of what needs to be done and any roadblocks faced during development.

**Project Boards** offer a visual representation of the workflow, allowing the team to see the status of each task in columns like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." 
This enhances transparency, making it easy to identify what tasks are being worked on, who is responsible for each, and what has already been completed.
